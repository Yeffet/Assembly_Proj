This is an Assembly-language project that demonstrates low-level programming concepts, such as working directly with CPU registers, memory addresses, and system calls. It serves as a foundation for understanding how higher-level programs interact with hardware through assembly instructions.

Specific Explanations

Core .asm File(s): Contain the main assembly logic, including setup of data segments and execution flow.

Data and Stack Management: Showcases how to allocate variables and manage stack-based operations like pushing/popping registers.

I/O Operations: Demonstrates reading user input or printing output via system calls or interrupts, emphasizing direct control over I/O.
